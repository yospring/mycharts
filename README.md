# Create and deploy a Node.js React application

React is a popular framework for creating user interfaces in modular components. In this sample application, you will create a web application using Express and React to serve web pages in Node.js, complete with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring.

This app contains an opinionated set of components for modern web development, including:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?starterKit=6b8ec7af-e3ce-3d7d-a1f4-396db8fd1184) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

    </a>
</p>

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and DevOps toolchain.  You will have the option of deploying to either Cloud Foundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6+ LTS version.

Once the Node toolchain has been installed, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Modern web applications require a compilation step to prepare your ES2015 JavaScript or Sass stylesheets into compressed Javascript ready for a browser. Webpack is used for bundling your JavaScript sources and styles into a `bundle.js` file that your `index.html` file can import. 

***Webpack***

For development mode, use `webpack -d` to leave the sources uncompress and with the symbols intact.

For production mode, use `webpack -p` to compress and obfuscate your sources for development usage.

***Gulp***

Gulp is a task runner for JavaScript. You can run the above Webpack commands in by running:
```bash
gulp
```

To run your application locally:
```bash
npm run start
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.  You can access the `/health` and `/appmetrics-dash` endpoints at the host.

<!--
#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:
```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the following commands:
```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:
```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
-->

##### Session Store

You may see this warning when running `ibmcloud dev run`:
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not
designed for a production environment, as it will leak
memory, and will not scale past a single process.
```

When deploying to production, it is best practice to configure sessions to be stored in an external persistence service.
